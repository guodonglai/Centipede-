Completed all tasks in Cycle 2. The Centipede now spawns at the top of each level,
and works its way down. The centipede splits on death, and restarts the level if the
hero dies. It "bounces" off walls and mushrooms, which can be destroyed with 4 shots.
Each shot makes the mushroom smaller.

Known bug:
When two segments of the centipede end up on top of each other, they delete each other.
