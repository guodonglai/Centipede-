Everything for this cycle is updated. The player can now pick up three different types
of guns. These guns can only be found in level 1. In addition when all of the segments of
the centipede have been destroyed the next level loads. The above actions run perfectly.
In addition three new enemies have been inplemented. These enemies work, however their
speed does not match the speed of the other Instances on the screen. For example the
player character moves at a speed of 2 pixels per frame, whereas the enemies that we have
implemented move at half that speed. Despite this difference, the enemies appear to move
faster and cause multiple images to appear on screen per frame. We are unsure as to the
cause of this bug, and plan to look into it closer on monday. This has also caused the
game to slow down considerably, making it very difficult to bug test the second half of
this cycle. (It took 4 hours to finish the whole thing. )
